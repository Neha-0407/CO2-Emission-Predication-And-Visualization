# CO2-Emission-Predication-And-Visualization
To predict or calculate CO2  emitted by different countries  by  applying machine learning models and doing visual analytics on the global available dataset and hence, suggesting methods to reduce and control the CO2 emitted.

For this project, we would be working on two datasets one from Kaggle and another one from the world bank.
Kaggle dataset contains data of CO2 emitted by different countries from the year 1750 till 2017.
The world bank dataset contains the amount of CO2 emitted by different sectors of different countries  from the year 1950 till 2020.
